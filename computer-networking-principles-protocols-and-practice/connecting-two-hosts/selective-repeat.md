# Selective Repeat

### Advantages over Go-Back-N
- Better strategy to recover from loses
- Allows receiver to accept out-of-sequence frames
- Only retransmits frames which that have been lost and not the frames that have been correctly received

### What happens at receiver?

- The receiver maintains a sliding window of _W_ frames and stores in a buffer the out-of-sequence frames.

- The receiver will discard the frames with invalid CRC
- The receiver will maintainer _lastack_ variable

```
lastack: sequence number of the last in-sequence frame
```

- The receiver sends value of `lastack` in each acknowledgement.
- The out-of-sequence data frame will be discarded if it is not present in the receiving window

### What happens at sender?

- Maintains a sending buffer which can accommodate _W_ unacknowledged frames
- In simple implementation of selective repeat sender, a retransmission timer is set for each frame

- Cumulative acknowledgement does work for selective repeat as it does for [[go-back-n]]
- A sender might retransmit the frame which was already received out-of-sequence
- To prevent this from happening, receiver attaches the sequence number of the frames received which are present in the window.
- **Selective Acknowledgement**: Acknowledgement containing list of the sequence numbers of all frames that have already been received
