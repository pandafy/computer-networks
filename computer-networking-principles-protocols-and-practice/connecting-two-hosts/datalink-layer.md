# Datalink Layer

Two types of datalink layers:

- Point to point datalink layer
  - only two communicating systems connected through physical layer.
  - **[[PPP]]** is an example of point-to-point datalink layer
- Datalink layer used in [[LAN]]

Different types of datalink layers have different frame size. The heterogeneity in the frame sizes makes it difficult to communicate with hosts working on different datalink layers
