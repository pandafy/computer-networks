# Routing Table

## With context to [[Distance Vector Routing]]

The routing table R can be modeled as a data structure that stores, for each known destination address d, the following attributes :
- `R[d].link` is the outgoing link that the router uses to forward packets towards destination d
- `R[d].cost` is the sum of the metrics of the links that compose the shortest path to reach destination d
- `R[d].time` is the timestamp of the last distance vector containing destination d
