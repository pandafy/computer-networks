# Label Switching

## With context to Virtual Circuit Organization

- Upon reception of a packet, a network node consults its [[label forwarding table]]
- Each network node that forwards a packet replaces the label of the forwarded packet with the label found in the label forwarding table

## Examples of technologies that uses label switching
- [[MultiProtocol Label Switching]] (MPLS)
- [[Asynchronous Transfer Mode]] (ATM)
- [[Frame Relay]]
