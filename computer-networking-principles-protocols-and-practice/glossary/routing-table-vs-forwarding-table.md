# Routing Table vs Forwarding Table

- [[Routing table]] is a software data structure. It is not usually directly used when forwarding packets.
- Packet forwarding relies on more compact data structure which is [[forwarding-table]]
- On high end router, the forwarding tables are implemented directly in the hardware, while on low end routers, the forwarding table is implemented on software level
- A forwarding table contains a subset of the information found in the routing table
- A forwarding table will typically associate each destination to one or more outgoing interface or nexthop router.
