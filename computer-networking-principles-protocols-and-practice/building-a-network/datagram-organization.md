# Datagram Organization

- Inspired by organization of postal services
- Each host is identified by _network layer address_
- To send information to remote host, the sender has to create a packet that contains:
  - network layer address of destination host
  - own network layer address
  - information to be sent
- Routers use _hop-by-hop forwarding_
- If the packet received by router is not destined to itself, it looks up the destination address of the packet in its [[forwarding table]]
